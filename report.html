<p>Why did we chose this topic? We decided to focus on workers' mental health during the pandemic because we all think it is extremely important to talk about. We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health and some people may not be educated on the topic of mental health so we wanted to provide input and data for people who want to get a better understanding and be more educated and aware of this crisis. We wanted to especially focus on specialists in the mental health field because of how those numbers have spiked and how they were impacted by this crisis and still have to go to work and deal with the pandemic while also dealing with their own mental health and personal lives.
